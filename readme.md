# Progressive Web Apps Starter Course

This repository contains the participant source files for the **Progressive Web Apps: Enhancing Your Web Apps Using Service Workers** webinar. You'll use these files during the webinar to turbo-charge a web app with service workers.

## Prerequisites

If you want to follow-along with the code, you'll need the following:

* A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You should already have this installed as Node.js is core to most modern web development approaches. 
* A local HTTP server such as [HTTP-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (Requires Node.js)
